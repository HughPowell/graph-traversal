# graph-traversal

Algorithms for graph traversal (don't use this, use [Loom](https://github.com/aysylu/loom) instead)

## Usage

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/HughPowell/graph-traversal.svg?branch=main)](https://travis-ci.com/HughPowell/graph-traversal)

Designed to be run from the REPL,

```shell
lein repl
```

The `dev.repl` namespace (the default repl namespace) will load in all of the
required functions (and tests).

To generate a random graph with 5 vertices and 10 edges

```clojure
(random-graph 5 10)
```

To find the shortest path between two vertices using Djikstra's algorithm

```clojure
(djikstras {:1 [[:2 1] [:3 2]]
            :2 [[:4 4]]
            :3 [[:4 2]]
            :4 []
            :1
            :4})
=> (:1 :3 :4)
```
If there is no path between the start and finish vertices then `:inifinty` is returned.

## Tests

[Kaocha](https://github.com/lambdaisland/kaocha) is used as the primary test runner. To
run the tests use the `kaocha` script in the `./bin` directory

```shell
./bin/kaocha
```

or within the REPL

```clojure
(run :property)
```
or
```clojure
(run-all)
```

Alternatively you can use the Clojure test runner.

```shell
lein test
```
