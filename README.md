# graph-traversal

Algorithms for graph traversal (don't use this, use [Loom](https://github.com/aysylu/loom) instead)

## Usage

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/HughPowell/graph-traversal.svg?branch=main)](https://travis-ci.com/HughPowell/graph-traversal)

Designed to be run from the REPL,

```shell
lein repl
```

There are 2 namespaces, `graph-traversal.graph` and `graph-traversal.algorithm`.

To generate a random graph with 5 vertices and 10 edges

```clojure
(require '[graph-traversal.graph :as graph])

(graph/random-graph 5 10)
```
